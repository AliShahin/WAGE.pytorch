# Training and Inference with Integers in Deep Neural Networks

PyTorch implementation for the ICLR 2018 oral paper, training on CIFAR10. This is replicate from the Tensorflow [repo](https://github.com/boluoweifenda/WAGE) by the paper's authors. We hope the PyTorch implementation could also help with low-precision training research.

## Prerequisites
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA + CuDNN
- PyTorch
- TensorboardX 
- Tabulate
- tqdm

Please follow the official instruction to install PyTorch and NVIDIA related prerequisites. Other things should be handled by
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train
Start training using the following scripts:
```bash
./wage.sh
```
